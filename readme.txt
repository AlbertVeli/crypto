The JCrypTool crypto project contains all crypto plug-ins for JCrypTool: Algorithms (classic and modern), Analysis, Games, Visualizations and XML Security. Basic crypto features are included in this repository too.

This repository requires the plug-ins from the JCrypTool Core repository to compile and to run.

Have a look at our wiki at https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki for more information on how to get you started as a JCrypTool developer. Feel free to ask any question you might have in our developers group at http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-developers.
