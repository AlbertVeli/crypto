<h1>Manual</h1>

<p>The following image represents the start screen of the game Number Shark. The main parts of the view are the toolbar, the playing field, an overview of the score and a table with detailed information of the game course.</p>

<h2>1. The View</h2>
<h3>1.1 The Playing Field</h3>
<p>The playing field is separated, depending on the size of the playing field (in the screenshot 190) into tabs. Each tab contains up to 40 buttons, each representing a chooseable number.</p>
<p>Numbers which are still chooseable are displayed in blue, in contrast to numbers which are already taken appear in grey and are deactivated. If you remain on an active numbers for a second, a tooltip will appear, providing detailed information such as remaining active divisors and whether the number itself is a divisor of a number in the playing field.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"New Game"</strong></li>
  
  <p>By clicking on &quot;New Game&quot; a dialog will appear, where you can set up a new game and define the size of the playing field, the size can vary from 1 to 1024.</p>
  <p><img src="Manual_4.jpg" alt="Neues Spiel Dialog"></p>
  
  <li><strong>"Undo"</strong></li>
  
  <p>The last move can be undone.</p>

  <li>"<strong>Redo</strong>"</li>
  
  <p>An undone step can be redone.</p>
  <li><strong>"Shark meal"</strong></li>
  
  <p>This button deactivates all numbers which the shark will eventually get. More precisely, those are the numbers which are larger than the half of the size of the playing field without any active divisors.<br>
    Those numbers will surely be points, the shark will get.
  </p>

  <li><strong>"Hint&quot;</strong></li>
  
  <p>Generates a hint for a number which can be chosen next. In some situations a hint cannot be provided.</p>
  <li><strong>&quot;Heuristic strategies&quot;</strong></li>
  <p>Different heuristic strategies, which lead to winning situations can be analyzed here. Further information can be found in &quot;2. Heuristic strategies&quot;.</p>
  <li><strong>&quot;Optimal strategies&quot;</strong></li>

  <p>A wizard to calculate strategies, which are optimal. Detailed information can be found in &quot;3. Optimal strategies&quot;.</p>

</ul>
<h3>1.3 The overview of the score</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Current points"</strong></li>

<p>In this group, your score and the score of the shark are displayed, the colors significate who is currently leading the game. Are your points in green, you are about to win, are your points showed in red, you should get some points.<br>
  The number next to &quot;Minimal Points to win&quot;, is the the number you should try to reach to win the game.</p>
<li><strong>"Overview table: Detailed  score"</strong></li>
<p>This table provides information of the game. For each move you can review which number you took and how many points to had. You as well can find the numbers you lost in this move. Further more, you get the number of remaining numbers and the score of the shark.</p>
</ul>


<h2 id = "heuStrat">2. The Heuristic Strategies</h2>
<p>After playing a bit you might already have developed your first strategy how to win against the shark. The wizard for heuristic strategies (<img src="Manual_heuStrat.jpg" alt="Wizard heuristic strategies">) provides some strategies which leads to winning move sequences.</p>
<h3>2.1 The Wizard for Heuristic Strategies </h3>
<p>By clicking on <img src="Manual_heuStrat.jpg" alt="Wizard heuristic strategies"> the wizard for heuristic strategies appears. At the moment three different strategies are implemented. Those strategies can be selected with the radio buttons. The lower sliders define the lower and upper bounds of the playing field sizes for which the move sequences will be calculated.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Maximize the points you win in each move"</strong></li>
  <p>This strategy takes the number which maximizes the getting in each round. Which means it searches the number where the difference of the number you'll get and the sum of the numbers the shark will get is at its maximum. If the number is not unique, the maximum of those numbers will be taken.</p>

  <li><strong>"Heuristic strategy based on van Nek's algorithm"</strong></li>

  <p>This strategy is based on the algorithm of van Nek which is used to find the optimal winning move sequences. (For details see "3. Optimal Strategies")<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Let N be the size of the playing field.<br>
    <br>
   Step 1: Take the largest number larger than N/2 + 1 with exactly one active divisor.<br>
   Step 2: As long as there is still a number which has the property of the number in Step 1, go back to Step 1.<br>
    Step 3: Generate a list of number containing the following numbers:<br>
  - All numbers, with the smallest amount of active divisors which are larger than N/2 + 1<br>
  - The greatest number, which has exactly one divisor and is less than N/2 + 1<br>
   Step 4: Of the list you have just created ramdomly take a number as your next move.<br>
  Step 5: As long as there are still active numbers, go back to Step 1.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Heuristic Strategy by Schu (Version 1)"<br>
  </strong><br>

  Let N be the size of the playing field.<br>
  <br>
  Step 1: Calculate randomly a first border value out of the interval N/2+1 down   to 0. <BR>
  Step 2: Take the largest active integer with the fewest divisors in the interval N down to the first border value. <BR>
  Step 3: Calculate randomly a   second border value out of the interval N down to N/2+1. <BR>
  Step 4: Take the   largest pseudo prime in the interval N down to the second border value. <BR>
  Step   5: As your current move take randomly one number out of the numbers calculated in step 2 and 4 <BR>
  Step 6: Repeat from Step 1 as long as there are still free   numbers. </li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
By clicking &quot;Okay&quot;, the move sequences will be calculated with the bounds and the algorithm you have selected. Depending on your computer the process of calculating might take a while.<br>
Finally the result dialog will appear. Sorted by the size of the playing field, you can find the following information: First you see the score you can reach, then the score the shark will get. Next is the move sequence which is required to reach the points. In the last column the time which was need to calculate the sequence is shown. If you select a row you can press the button &quot;Play selected..&quot; Then a new game will be set up and the moves of the sequence you selected will be played. Then you can see in the lower table more detailed information.<br>
With
&quot;Save as...&quot; the whole table can be exported as a &quot;.csv&quot;-File and can be opened e.g. in Excel.</p>

<h2 id = "optStrat">3. The optimal strategies</h2>

<p>You might have already found your own strategy and winning against the shark is maybe not a problem for you anymore. Then the question about an optimal move sequence - a sequence which leads to a maximum score - arises. And you might ask yourself if there is a strategy which always gives you an optimal sequences. (Note: The sequences are not unique, there are different sequences which lead to the same score!)</p>
<p>Unfortunately we haven't yet found such a strategy. The first numbers which have to be taken are sure (Such as the first move the largest prime number has to be taken). But then at some point there are several possibilities and we could not yet figure out a main connection which of those numbers has to be taken. But with the algorithm of van Nek, we managed to cleverly try all possibilties and discard unuseful branches, such that an optimal move sequence can be given. The wizard for optimal strategies shows you optimal move sequence, you even can recalculate the sequences with the algorithm (up to n = 400). <br>
  A look to the wizard is worth it, maybe you can find a strategy which always finds an optimal sequence?
</p>
<h3>3.1 The wizard optimal strategies</h3>
<p>By clicking on the (completely filled) star icon  <img src="Manual_optStrat.jpg" alt=""/> in the toolbar  the wizard to calculate optimal strategies pops up. There you got to choose between the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"Show pre-calculated optimal strategies (for playing fields of size 2-250)"</strong></li>
  <p>Already calculated move sequences for the playing field sizes between 2 and 250 can be viewed and analyzed here.</p>
  <li><strong>"Calculate the optimal strategy with the algorithm of van Nek"</strong></li>
  <p>By choosing this option, move sequences can be calculated with the backtracking algorithm developed by van Nek. Further more you can set the range of playing field sizes you want the sequences to be calculated for.<br>
    Note: The run time of the algorithm is exponential in the size of the playing field, so depending on the interval you chose, the calculating process might take a while.
    <br>
  <br>

  Here we give a (simplified) description of the algorithm, let N be  the size of the playing field.<br>
  <br>
  Step 1: Take the largest number larger than N/2 + 1 with exactly one active divisor.<br>
  Step 2: As long as there is still a number which has the property of the number in Step 1, go back to Step 1.<br>
   Step 3: For each remaining number, branch the problem into a subproblem by taking this number. And do the following steps for each subproblem.<br>
   Step 4: If there 
   is still a free number, go back to Step 1, otherwise save the result as new optimal move sequence, if the score is better than the score of the subproblems you have already considered.<br>
   Step 5: Go to another not yet finished subproblem.<br>
   <br>
   The description to this algorithm is just the main idea. Van Nek in his implementation used some other 
   queries because it is not always needed to evaluate some subproblems till the end. E.g. before considering a subproblem the algorithm tests if it is still possible with the remaining numbers to exceed the current optimal score.
</ul>
By clicking on &quot;Okay&quot;, the move sequences will be showed or re-calculated with the algorithm, depending on your selection. Depending on your computer the process of calculating might take a while.<br>
Finally the result dialog will appear. Sorted by the size of the playing field, you can find the following information: First you see the maximal score you can reach, then the score the shark will get. Next is the move sequence which is required to reach the score. In the last column the time which was need to calculate the sequence is shown. If you select a row you can press the button &quot;Play selected..&quot; Then a new game will be set up and the moves of the sequence you selected will be played. Then you can see in the lower table more detailed information.<br>
With
&quot;Save as...&quot; the whole table can be exported as a &quot;.csv&quot;-File and can be opened e.g. in Excel.
