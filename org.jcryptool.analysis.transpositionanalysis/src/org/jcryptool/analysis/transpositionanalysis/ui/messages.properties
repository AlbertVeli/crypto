KeyViewer_cryptoversion=Version for cryptographic use - e.g. deciphering a text, ...
KeyViewer_invertback=Invert the key back (to the initial state)
KeyViewer_invertdescription=Invert the Key (The inverted key is the exact opposite of original key. Encrypting a text with a key, and then with the inverse key, will result in the original text.)
KeyViewer_invertone=Invert
KeyViewer_prettyversion="Pretty version" - for copying into text, etc.
ReadDirectionChooser_0=column-wise
ReadDirectionChooser_1=row-wise
TextInputWithSourceDisplayer_editorOpenHint=By clicking on the icon, you can show the original editor for the text.
TextInputWithSourceDisplayer_fileOpenHint=By clicking on the icon, you can open the file in an editor.
TextInputWithSourceDisplayer_manualinput=Manual input
TextInputWithSourceDisplayer_originLabelBeginning=(Origin\: 
TextInputWithSourceDisplayer_userinputOpenHint=By clicking on the icon, you can open your input in an editor.
TranspAnalysisUI_Export=Export
TranspAnalysisUI_Results=Results
TranspAnalysisUI_btnOpenTextWizard_text=Load text
TranspAnalysisUI_decipher=Write displayed preview text into a new editor
TranspAnalysisUI_grpEditText=Edit the loaded text (set column count, column reordering)
TranspAnalysisUI_keyfound=Key (corresponds to column order)\:
TranspAnalysisUI_keypreview_zerocolumns=[Can only be determined with a column count > 0]
TranspAnalysisUI_keyviewer=Key viewer
TranspAnalysisUI_label_2_text=3)
TranspAnalysisUI_lbl_params_mask=\n- read-in-direction of text into the transposition table: %s, \n- read-out-direction of the text in the transposition table: %s\n- Alphabet: "Printable ASCII"
TranspAnalysisUI_lblChooseAnotherText=<a>(choose another text)</a>
TranspAnalysisUI_lblColumnCount_text_1=Column count\: 
TranspAnalysisUI_lblHoweverTheColumn_text=However, you have to find the column count of the table first. The way to find the right combination - column reordering and column count - is to start with reordering the table columns, considering the first line only. If the following lines won't look right, start over with another column count.
TranspAnalysisUI_lblLoadedTextwith_text=Loaded text (with reorderable colums)\:
TranspAnalysisUI_lblNewLabel_1_text=Parameters of the cipher\: 
TranspAnalysisUI_lblTheResultsthe_text=The results (the key and the decrypted text) of the above steps are displayed here. If the preview of the deciphered text looks good, you can write it into a new editor by clicking the button below the text box.
TranspAnalysisUI_lblTryToRecover_text=Try to recover the plain text by reordering the columns of the table, such that the transposition of the text is reversed.
TranspAnalysisUI_lblYouHaveSelected_text=Your selected input\:
TranspAnalysisUI_link_text=<a>Set own key</a>
TranspAnalysisUI_preview=Preview (deciphered text)
TranspAnalysisUI_read_out_mode_label=Read-out mode of the table\:
TranspAnalysisUI_tooltipParams=The read-in/read-out parameters are given in the form that is required \nby the transposition algorithm wizard in JCrypTool: from encryption sight. \nThe read-in-direction parameter for the transposition algorithm is the read-out direction \nfrom this analysis and the other way around because this analysis resembles the decryption.
TranspAnalysisUI_view_description=Here you can perform an analysis to decipher a text encrypted by simple column transposition.
