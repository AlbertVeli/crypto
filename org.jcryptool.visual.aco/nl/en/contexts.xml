    <description>The Ant Colony Optimization is an algorithm based on the behaviour of ants searching for food. Ants have developed a method to find efficiently a shortest path between two points. For doing so, each ant drops pheromons which will help other ants to follow or not follow the path the ant took. In optimization such a behvaiour can be converted to the problem of finding a shortest path in a graph. By storing local information on each edge, such as how many ants have already passed the edge, following ants can decide which way to take.</description>
