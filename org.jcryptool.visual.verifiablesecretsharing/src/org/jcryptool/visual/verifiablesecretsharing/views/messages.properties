VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description=Verifiable Secret Sharing is a variation of the simple secret sharing scheme. As with the simple scheme, the secret is split into n shares and distributed to n players,\nso that any number t of the players can reconstruct the secret, while less than t players cannot. However, in the simple scheme one player can covertly sabotage a\nreconstruction by modifying his share. Verifiable secret sharing introduces an improvement to the simple secret sharing scheme by adding a function 'Check' by\nwhich each player can verify the correctness of all shares ('Verifiability'). \r\nWhen the mouse focus is set on a container, a corresponding detailed explanation is displayed in the box below.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_error_start=The following conditions must be fulfilled:

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_player_t_smaller_n=The number of players required for reconstruction cannot be larger than the total number of players (t <= n)!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_module_p_bigger_s=The safe prime p must be at least twice as big as the secret!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_module_p_isPrime=A safe prime must be entered for p!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_primitive_g=The generator g must be an element of order q!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_set_all=Not all parameters have been entered, therefore random values will be used.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_p_not_safe_prime=The chosen p is not a safe prime! It will now be set to the next larger safe prime.

ChartComposite_reconstruct_success=Reconstruction of the polynomial has been successful.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_left=In this step, the parameters are chosen.\n\r  \u2022 Number of players n [n \u2208 \u2115; n > 1] (mandatory item)\n\r  \u2022 Number of players t required for reconstruction [t \u2208 \u2115; 1 < t \u2264 n] (mandatory item)\n\r  \u2022 Secret s [s \u2208 \u2115] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 Will be randomly generated if nothing is entered.\n\r    \u2012 Is limited to 2,000,000 to keep the calculations within an appropriate time.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_right=  \u2022 Safe prime p [p \u2208 \u2119; p > 2s] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 will be generated automatically.\n\r    \u2012 A Safe Prime is a prime number of the form 2q + 1 with q prime as well. \n\r  \u2022 Generator g [g \u2208 \u2124_p; order(g)  =  q] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 will be generated automatically.\n\r  \u2022 q [q \u2208 \u2119] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 It is the biggest prime factor of p-1, while q = (p-1)/2.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_left=In this step, the coefficients a\u1D62 [a\u1D62 \u2208 \u2115; 1 \u2264 a\u1D62 < q] for the polynomial P(x) will be set.\n\rOnly coefficients greater than 0 are allowed because otherwise the security of the algorithm may be compromised.\n\rThey can be set either manually, or be generated randomly.\n\ra\u2080 is the secret s. \n\rThe remaining coefficients a\u2081 to a_(t-1) are set to 1 by default.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_right=The polynomial P(x) is constructed as follows: P(x) = a\u2080 + a\u2081x + a\u2082x\u00B2 + ... + a_(t-1)x^(t-1)\n\rIf all coefficients are set, the polynomial will be displayed\n\rand it is possible to calculate the commitments and shares.\n\rThe calculation of the shares is independent from the calculation of the commitments. \n\rThe commitments are required for checking the shares.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_commitments_left=In this step, the commitments Y\u2091 for each coefficient a\u2091 are calculated as follows: \n\r Y\u2091 = g ^ a\u2091 mod p \n\rThey are needed in order to check the shares.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_commitments_right

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_left=In this step, the shares for each player i are calculated as follows: \n\rN\u1D62 = P(i) mod q \n\rThe value of i identifies each player, while P(i) is the polynomial. \n\rThe shares are displayed in their original size, which is used for the visualization of the graph, and modulo q.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_right=The check verifies that the share fits the committed polynomial. \n\rThe check of the shares needs to be performed for each player individually. \n\rIf the check has been successful, the share is marked in green, and marked in red if false. \n\rThe shares can be falsified to show how an altered share influences the reconstruction. \n\rThe calculation is performed as follows:

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_left=In this step, the polynomial and hence the secret will be reconstructed.\n\rFor reconstructing the polynomial, at least t shares need to be selected to take part in the reconstruction. \n\rThe reconstruction is done through a Lagrange-Interpolation:
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_right=  \u2022 Keep in mind: \n\r    \u2012 u is the number of chosen players and\n\r    \u2012 x_k and x_l are the players' identification indices.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_right_part2=The result is the polynomial P'(x).\n\rIf the chosen number of players is sufficient, i.e., >= t, P'(x) and P(x) are identical, and in the consequence the coefficient a\u2080 of P'(x) is the secret s.
