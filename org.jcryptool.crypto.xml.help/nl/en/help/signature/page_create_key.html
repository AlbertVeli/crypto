Select an existing keystore (probably one you created before with the help of the <a href="/help/topic/org.eclipse.wst.xml.security.doc/html/signature/page_create_keystore.html" title="help/topic/org.eclipse.wst.xml.security.doc/html/signature/page_create_keystore.html">Create a new Key and a new Keystore</a> wizard) and enter the keystore password. After that simply select the desired algorithm and the algorithm size for the new key and enter a name and a password for it. Click the <b>Generate</b> button when you are done to create the new key. A short message informs you about the generation result and the <b>Next</b> button will be enabled. The key generated here will be used in the active signature process.</p><p><img align="middle" title="Insert a new Key in an existing Keystore" alt="Insert a new Key in an existing Keystore" border="0" src="../images/sign/page_2b.pngâ€Ž"/></p><p>Keys must be unique inside a keystore, so the wizard verifies that the entered key name does not exist in the selected keystore.</p><p>The wizard automatically stores the entered data for the keystore path and name between sessions. Passwords are never stored and have to be entered every time.</p></body></html>
